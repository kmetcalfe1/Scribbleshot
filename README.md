A Shmup with children's drawing feel. 

Initial Entry- 

My Shmup will be based on a gradeschool desk, with a kid’s drawing of a dinosaur fighting a magic princess. The aesthetic revolves around cute, imaginative doodles kids enjoy, such as rocketships, balloons, dinosaurs, etc.

Some of fullerton’s elements  include:

-Players, there is a single player playing the game

-Objectives, shoot the boss to kill him while dodging attacks

-Boundaries, the player cannot move very far to the left or right, and only has a jump (the player must be quick)

Challenges include swapping/randomized boss patterns. As the boss gets to 75, 50, and 25 percent health, it switches attack patterns to one of five randomized patterns, keeping the player on his or her feet. One pattern involves a constant spray of bullets, offering the player a maneuverability challenge. Another might show very fast rocketships coming from different places on the screen; the player can shoot these special projectiles to avoid taking damage. Another would be slow objects that the character can jump on (shaped as balloons) that the player can use to avoid enemy attacks. Another would be clouds that quickly form and disappear that the player must jump on to avoid a lengthy laser shot.

The rules are pretty simple- move backwards and forwards with A and D keys, jump with the W key, and shoot directly forward with the space bar. The player must shoot at the dinosaur boss and deplete his health to win before the player is killed by the boss. The simple rules allow for the player to focus more on predicting the next move of the boss, as dodging is very important with the player’s very limited health bar!

Midpoint Entry- 

After playtesting, I learned of many opinions on the game mechanics. They were as follows:

-"It is too hard to win with only 3 lives/bubbles." I fixed this by making it so the player gains an extra life if lives are lost when a phase is completed.

-"It is hard to know when I've lost a life/a bubble popped." I added a pop sound, and now losing a life is more obvious. 

-"The laser fires too quickly without warning." I added a laser "charging" noise and some time before the fire to let players know the laser is coming. 

-"Balloons in the party phase block my shots at the boss." I made it so The ballons are destroyed on projectile impact, but I liked that they blocked impact on the boss, so I didn't change this. 

-"It is too easy to stay away from the rockets." I added more spawn points for rockets so rockets can potentially hit every point on the screen.
