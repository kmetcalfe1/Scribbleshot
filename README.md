A Shmup with children's drawing feel. 

My Shmup will be based on a gradeschool desk, with a kid’s drawing of a dinosaur fighting a magic princess. The aesthetic revolves around cute, imaginative doodles kids enjoy, such as rocketships, knights, unicorns, etc.

Some of fullerton’s elements  include:

-Players, there is a single player playing the game

-Objectives, shoot the boss to kill him while dodging attacks

-Boundaries, the player cannot move very far to the left or right, and only has a small jump (the player must be quick)

Challenges include swapping/randomized boss patterns. As the boss gets to 75, 50, and 25 percent health, it switches attack patterns to one of five randomized patterns, keeping the player on his or her feet. One pattern involves a constant spray of bullets, offering the player a maneuverability challenge. Another might show very fast rocketships coming from different places on the screen; the player can shoot these special projectiles for extra damage on the boss. Another would be slow projectiles that follow the character (shaped as balloons that pop on impact with a platform or floor). Another would be clouds that quickly form and disappear that the player must jump on to avoid a lengthy breath of fire. The last one involves the boss getting a shield and hitting the boss with a specific number of hits that match the number of projectiles the enemy is launching at you to do damage and break the shield.

The rules are pretty simple- move backwards and forwards with A and D keys, jump with the W key, and shoot directly forward with the space bar. The player must shoot at the dinosaur boss and deplete his health to win before the player is killed by the boss. The simple rules allow for the player to focus more on predicting the next move of the boss, as dodging is very important with the player’s very limited health bar!

I am also considering a survival mode, in which patterns keep changing within the 5 patterns after enough damage has been done to the boss. This might only be fun with more variations in patterns, though.

I started with the code from chapter 30 nd 31 but found many issues with the colliders.
